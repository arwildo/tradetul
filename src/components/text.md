# Why Risk Management so important
Trading capital is trader main working tool. 
If you run out of funds to trade, you will be unable to trade and thus lose your job. 
No matter which market you are trading or which trading strategy you apply, 
losses are inevitably going to happen.

Therefore, protecting your trading capital needs to always have the highest priority. 
Ideally, the amount you risk on each trade should be based on two thing: 
  1. Drawdown Tolerance
  2. Choosing Position 


# Controlling Drawdown
A drawdown is the reduction of your trading capital after a series of losses. 
The drawdown is calculated as a percentage difference between the peak in your 
trading capital minus the capital after a series of losses.

No matter how strong your trading strategy is, you will eventually experience
a losing streak. The bigger the drawdown, the harder it will be to recover 
from the drawdown. Now, what is the reasonable limit? Have a look at the table below.

The above table illustrates what is the percentage gain required to recover lost capital. 
If you notice, at 25% loss, we need 33.3% gain to recover the loss and get back to breakeven.
Therefore choosing the right risking between 1-3% account capital  per trade is the best 
practice.

# Choosing Position
Choosing Position size depends on the invalidation point, i.e. at what point
the market structure change and the market will change its movement structure.
An invalidation level is where the market structure for the trade could potentially 
change. Remember, you trade in the direction of the market structure.  Market 
structure Changes, the trade should end.

Why only risk 3%
